\subsection{Update DOM \bf{wf:update}}
You can update part of the page or DOM element with given
element or even raw HTML. Also you can use {\bf \#dtl}
or {\bf \#eex} template elements for HTML generation to
replace. Here is example of simple {\bf \#span} or
{\bf \#br} elements which are HTML counterparts:

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    wf:update(history,[#span{body="Hello"},#br{}]).
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

It generates DOM update script and sends it to
WebSockets for evaluation.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    $('#history').html('<span>Hello</span><br>').
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

Companions are also provided for updating head and tail
of the elements list: {\bf wf:insert\_top/2} and
{\bf wf:insert\_bottom/2}, which turns to approriative
JavaScript methods {\bf prepend} and {\bf append} during render.

\paragraph{}
For relative updates {\bf wf:inser\_before\/2} and {\bf wf:inser\_after/2}.
For remove element you should use {\bf wf:remove/2}.
Better understanding of updates you can find in {\bf Section 7}.

\paragraph{\bf Elements Naming.} You can specify element id with Erlang atoms,
lists or binaries. During render the value will be converted
with {\bf wf:to\_list}. Only if you are using atoms convertation would be consistent,
otherwise you need to care about illegal symbols for element accessor
in jQuery, Zepto or Minified.

\paragraph{}
During page updates you can create additional elements with
run-time generated event handlers, process HTML render from
template elements or even use distributed map/reduce to calculate view.
You should know that heavy operations will consume
more power in browser, however you can save it by rendering
HTML on server side. All DOM updates API works both using
JavaScript/OTP and server pages 

\paragraph{}
List of elements you can use is given in Section 7. You can also create
you own elements with custom render.

\newpage
\subsection{Wire JavaScript \bf{wf:wire}}
Just like HTML is generated from Elements, Actions are rendered into
JavaScript to handle events raised in the browser. Actions always
transformed into JavaScript and sent through WebSockets pipe.

\subsection*{Direct Wiring}
There are two type of actions. First class is direct JavaScript
strings given directly as Erlang lists or via JavaScript/OTP
transformations.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    wf:wire("window.location='http://synrc.com'").
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Actions Render}
Second class is actions which are in fact Erlang records being
rendered during page load, server events or client events.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    wf:wire(#alert{text="Hello!"}).
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

However basic N2O actions which are a part of N2O API, {\bf wf:update} and {\bf wf:redirect},
are implemented as Erlang records as given in example. In case you need deffered
render of JavaScript you can use Erlang records instead of direct wiring with
Erlang lists or JavaScript/OTP.

\paragraph{}
Any action wired with {\bf wf:wire} is enveloped with {\bf \#wire\{actions=[]\}}
which is also action capable to polymorph render of custom or built-in actions specified in list.
Following nested action embedding are also valid:

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    wf:wire(#wire{actions=[#alert{text="N2O"}]}).
\end{lstlisting}
\vspace{1\baselineskip}

\newpage
\subsection{Async Processes {\bf wf:async} and {\bf wf:flush}}
Creates Erlang processes communicating with the primary page
process by sending messages. For redirecting all updates and
wire actions to the page process {\bf wf:flush} should be called.
Usually you send messages to Async processes over N2O
message bus but you can use any.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    body() ->
        {ok,Pid} = wf:async("looper",fun() -> loop(0) end),
      [ #span   { id=counter },
        #button { id=sendButton, body="Send", postback={inc,Pid} } ].

    event({inc,Pid}) -> wf:reg(room), Pid ! inc.

    loop(Counter) ->
        Body = wf:to_list(Counter),
        receive inc -> wf:update(counter, #span { body=Body }),
                       wf:flush(room) end, loop(Counter+1).
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{\bf Process Naming.} The name of async process is globally unique. There are two
versions {\bf wf:async/1} and {\bf wf:async/2}. In given example
the name of async process is specified as ``looper'', otherwise default name
``comet'' would apply when first parameter is not specified.

\subsection{Message Bus {\bf wf:reg} and {\bf wf:send}}
N2O uses GProc process registry for managing async processes pools.
It is used as a PubSub message bus for N2O communications, but later you can switch to robust RabbitMQ.
You can assign a process to the pool with {\bf wf:reg} and send a message to the pool with {\bf wf:send}.

\vspace{1\baselineskip}
\begin{lstlisting}
    loop() ->
        receive M -> wf:info("P: ~p, M: ~p",[self(),M]) end, loop().
\end{lstlisting}

Now you can test it

\begin{lstlisting}
    > spawn(fun() -> wf:reg(topic), loop() end).
    > spawn(fun() -> wf:reg(topic), loop() end).
    > wf:send(topic,"Hello").
\end{lstlisting}

It should prints in REPL something like:

\begin{lstlisting}
    > [info] P: <0.2012.0>, M: "Hello"
    > [info] P: <0.2015.0>, M: "Hello"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Parse URL and Context parameters {\bf wf:q} and {\bf wf:qs}}
These are used to extract URL parameters or read from the process context. {\bf wf:q} extracts variables
from the context stored by controls postbacks and {\bf wf:qs} extracts variables from HTTP forms.

\subsection{Render {\bf wf:render}}
Renders elements or actions with common render.

\subsection{Redirects {\bf wf:redirect}}
Redirects are not implemented with HTTP headers but with JavaScript action modifying {\bf window.location}.
This saves login context information and sends it in the first packet upon establishing a WebSocket connection.

\subsection{Session Information {\bf wf:session}}
Stores any session information in ETS tables. Use {\bf wf:user}, {\bf wf:role} for
login and authorization. See {\bf AVZ} library.

\subsection{Bridge information {\bf wf:header} and {\bf wf:cookie}}
You can read and issue cookie and headers information using internal Web-Server routines.
You can also read peer IP with {\bf wf:peer}.
